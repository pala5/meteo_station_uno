This file includes the Slave code implemented to an ESP8266 board, LOLIN D1 mini PRO. 
It establishes WiFi communication via WiFi with a mobile phone using Blynk communication.
In the code you must change the SSID, PASSWORD and AUTH_TOKEN for yours.
When you create a Blynk project, its generates a random auth_token that you must put in your device code, in this case into the Lolin's code.
